## Project Description
This is my frist project in the bootcamp where I'll build the hangman game. I've choshen this game because it's a classic from my childhood and I think it will be a good start to practice my coding skills and the basic concepts I have learned in these first weeks.

## Rules
Player has to guess a word by suggesting letters in 6 attempts before the man gets hung! 

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
1. Researched about the game.
2. Designed game structure (pseudocode).
3. Created a Kanban Board (Trello).
4. Cloned remote repository in GitHub.
5. Created gitignore file.
6. Updated README.md file.
7. Coded game.
8. Tested game (error handling).
9. Prepared presentation (Google Slides).

## Organization
I've organized my work by using a Trello Kanban Board (template provided).

This repository has the following files: 

1. words.py (word list needed to run the code).
2. embed.ipynb (the source code).
3. hangman.ipynb (where the game will be displayed).
4. README.md file with the project description.
5. gitignore file.
